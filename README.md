## üìå Getting Started

1. Follow **[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md)** to install dependencies, run services, import resources, run tests, and launch chat.
2. Adjust mocks or tools to fit your environment‚Äîswap in real APIs without changing agent logic.
3. Extend agents with new features or integrate with real-world systems via additional connections/tools.

## üîß ServiceNow Integration Setup

The `run-service-now.sh` script provides automated setup for ServiceNow integration with watsonx Orchestrate. This script configures the complete ServiceNow environment including connections, tools, and agents.

### Prerequisites

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```bash
WO_API_KEY=your_orchestrate_api_key_here
SERVICE_NOW_URL=your_servicenow_instance_url_here
SERVICE_NOW_PASSWORD=your_servicenow_password_here
```

### What the Script Does

The `run-service-now.sh` script performs the following automated setup:

1. **Environment Activation**: Activates the wxo-cloud environment using the API key from `.env`
2. **Connection Management**: 
   - Removes existing service-now connection if present
   - Adds new service-now connection
   - Configures connection with ServiceNow URL and credentials
3. **Tool Imports**:
   - Healthcare tools: `get_my_claims.py`, `get_healthcare_benefits.py`, `search_healthcare_providers.py`
   - ServiceNow tools: `create_service_now_incident.py`, `get_my_service_now_incidents.py`, `get_service_now_incident_by_number.py`
4. **Agent Imports**: Imports `service_now_agent.yaml` and `customer_care_agent.yaml`

### Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x run-service-now.sh

# Run the setup script
./run-service-now.sh
```

The script provides clear feedback at each step and handles both automated and manual credential input scenarios.

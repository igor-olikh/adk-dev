## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

You’ll learn how to:
- Define and manage **connections**, **tools**, **KBs**, **flows**, **guidelines** and **starter prompts**
- Integrate and test with **mock services**
- Validate agent behavior with **pytest** and ADK evaluation
- Run an interactive chat UI using **orchestrate chat**

## 📌 Getting Started

1. Follow **[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md)** to install dependencies, run services, import resources, run tests, and launch chat.
2. Adjust mocks or tools to fit your environment—swap in real APIs without changing agent logic.
3. Extend agents with new features or integrate with real-world systems via additional connections/tools.
